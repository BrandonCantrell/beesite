			<p><small>As a preacher's kid Gene began singing and playing Gospel music at an early age.
Growing up going to Gospel concerts listening to the popular quartets from the 50's and 60's was a great
influence on Gene's love for music and he quickly realized this was his calling in life.

After seven years of accordion lessons Gene began to teach himself to play the piano. Influenced by the early
quartet piano greats and legendary country piano players Floyd Cramer and Hargus &#34Pig&#34 Robbins, Gene
developed his style.

From playing and singing in local Gospel groups Gene's career journey has been an interesting one. In 1983
Gene was hired by Country Music Hall of Famer Grandpa Jones to play the bass guitar. For three years he
 worked for Jones playing the Grand Ole Opry, Hee Haw and shows all across the country.

In the fall of 1985 Gene became a founding member of the pioneer Christian Country band White River.
White River had a nine year career with several number one songs including What Ya Gonna Do?, Rodeo
Preacher, I Like My Gospel Country and more. White River was Band of the Year in 1993 for the Christian
Country Music Association.

Gene's songwriting career began in 1975 with a number one song, He's Ready To Come & I'm Ready To Go
recorded and performed by The Rambos. His most notable song from 1986 is He Didn't Throw The Clay
Away, originally taken to the top of the charts by The Lesters and recorded by many groups since including
The Cathedrals. Gene wrote another hit Sing Me A Song About Jesus recorded by The Florida Boys.

Gene also loves Bluegrass music and is co&#45host of a syndicated Bluegrass Gospel radio show called Believers
Bluegrass, and is one of the emcee's at the largest Bluegrass festival in the midwest, The Starvy Creek
Bluegrass Festival, Conway, Missouri.

Gene is married with 5 children and 7 grandchildren. When not performing he loves to smoke meat and ride
his motorcycles.</small></p>

			<p><small>Billy Summers was born in Tulsa Oklahoma but he and his parents moved to Southern California in his early
years. Billy has been drumming since the age of 12. His first band was with his uncle and family friends. They
played 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s rock and country music of the day. As a young man he played rock and country rock
around Southern California with several different bands.

After moving to Arkansas in 1992 he played with another family and friends band known as the Clifty Drifters.
He has played with some of Eureka Springs&#39 finest players including some from the Pine Mountain Jamboree and
the Ozark Mountain Hoe Down. During that time he became acquainted with the Roaring River Sound Band and played with them for 2 seasons at the theater near Cassville. It was there that he met a young Cale Reavis and
through him Doug Clifton and the other members of New Road Band.

â€œI&#39m brand new to this band and to Southern Gospel Music in general, but feel truly blessed to have been asked
to  join this fantastic group of dedicated young men&#34.</small></p>
